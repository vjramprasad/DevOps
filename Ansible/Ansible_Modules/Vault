------------Ansible Vault

Ansible Vault is a feature of ansible that allows you to keep sensitive data such as passwords or keys in encrypted files, 
rather than as plaintext in playbooks or roles. These vault files can then be distributed or placed in source control.

ansible-vault create t.yaml  # To create encrypted files, it will ask password for encryption
cat t.yaml  # it will show encrypted data
ansible-vault edit t.yaml  # To edit the vault file
ansible-vault decrypt t.yaml # To decrypt the file
ansible-vault encrypt t.yaml # To encrypt the file
ansible-playbook t.yaml --ask-pass
