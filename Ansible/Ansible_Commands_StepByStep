Configuration Management Tool
IaaCode

Inventory:-List of hosts
Frank--->100 Machine
         Each every machine and installing Jdk 8 
		 Ansible-->Angentless

Simple, agentless IT automation
that anyone can use

----------------------------Installation of Ansible---------------------------
--Commands to install Ansible on Master node

	yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
	yum install ansible

--Configuration to setup SSH on Client and Master Machine
  --Remove the comments from the ssh/sshd_config file which is to be overwritten
	vi etc/ssh/sshd_config
  -- After making the changes restart the sshd
		systemctl restart sshd
  --Generate the public key on Master machine which is to shared with clients
	ssh-keygen
  --following file will be created at id_rsa.pub which contains the value of public key
     cd /root/.ssh
	 cat id_rsa.pub
  --Copy the content of id_rsa.pub	  file
  --Goto Client Machine and got to /root/.ssh folder and append the master's public key to authorized_keys files

--Add the hosts(IP addresses or  in hosts file on the master machine under /etc/ansible folder
  add client hosts 


--------------------Ansible Adhoc Commands---------------------------------

--To find the documentation of the modules
	ansible-doc -l | more
	ansible-doc -s yum
--To Run ping command for all hosts
	ansible all -m ping
--To Run ping command to specific slave 
	ansible -i hosts <<slave>>  -m ping
--To Run any command on the slave machine
	ansible -i hosts <<slave>> -m shell -a 'ls /home'
--Install A package on Client Machine

--I have added below clients int hosts file 
	172.31.27.53
	172.31.19.90
	172.31.31.119
------------------yum Module---------------
--Lets install apache server on 172.31.27.53 server if it is already installed then yum remove httpd
--run the command in  /etc/ansible folder because hosts file is available there
   ansible 172.31.27.53 -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present"
--lets verify it on the slave machine (it should be available)
   service httpd status
------------------service module-------------
--Now the service is present but it is not in started state on slave machine so lets Start the service on client using ansible on master machine
   ansible 172.31.27.53 -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"
   --Notice that State is changed=true
--Check the status on client machine (it should be in active state)
  service httpd status 
--Lets start service httpd again on master machine  
   ansible 172.31.27.53 -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"
   --Notice that State is changed=false because it is already started
--Please try the same commands with state=stopped,restarted

--Repeat the steps to install nmap service

--------------------Copy module-------------
-- Create a file in master server and lets copy it to all or some of the slave servers
   Step1 :-> Create a file in master machine (/tmp/testfile) 
             touch /tmp/testingfile
			 echo "test for ansible copy module"  > /tmp/testfile
   Step2:-> check on 172.31.27.53 that there is no file /tmp/testingfile
   Step3:-> run the following command on master machine
             ansible 172.31.27.53 -m copy -a "src=/tmp/testfile dest=/tmp/testfile"   
   Step4:-> check on the slave machine it should have the file in /tmp/testfile

							Ansible-Playbook	YAML (Ain't Markup Language) .yaml or .yml
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1. It is data serialization language designed to be directly writeable and readable by humans
2. It is commonly used for configuration Management.
3. Strictly speaking YAML is a superset of json with additional features like indentation or new line
4. It is a case sensitive scripting language.

Q:->What is key?
Ans:-Key represents a variable or column for a value eg name: httpd  in this case name is the key and httpd is the value
Q:-> what is Data Types?
Ans:->Data Type represents the type of value we are storing in the key
      eg x:25  # it is integer
	     x:"Ansible" # it is string
		 x:2.3 # "it is float
		 x:true # it is Boolean
		 x:null # it is null
Q:-What is Data Collection?
Ans:-Generally when we represent the data it is key value pair which is called scalar representation of data.If we use multiple values or single key 
     or multiple key value pair it is called Data collection.
Q:-What are the different types of Data collection?
Ans:- It is of 2 types
       Sequence data collection:- it is like array in other programming language
	       tasks:
			 - name:
			 - debug:
		Map data collection:-it is equivalent to dictionary in python
		   tasks:
			 - name: home dir
			 - debug: true
		 Map data collection can have Sequence data collection
			tasks:
			 - name: home dir
			 - debug:
			     var: result.stdout

Q:-What is Ansible Playbook?
Ans:- Ansible Playbook book is a yaml script. It sends the commands to remote server in scripted way instead of using Ansible commands indviually
      to configure remote server from command line.
Q:- What is Ansible Playbook Structure?
Ans:-Each playbook is an aggregation of one or more plays in it. Playbooks are structured using Plays. There can be more than one play inside a 
     playbook.The function of a play is to map a set of instructions defined against a particular host.
     YAML is a strict typed language; so, extra care needs to be taken while writing the YAML files. 
	 There are different YAML editors but we will prefer to use a simple editor like notepad++. 
	 Just open notepad++ and copy and paste the below yaml and change the language to YAML (Language → YAML).
	 Egs
	 Task:-Install a apache server on remote machine
	 Play:-Consist of 1 or more tasks like install apache server and start the service
	 Playbook:-Composed or 1 or more play

----------Create a Playbook----------
A YAML starts with --- (3 hyphens)

Syntax
   --- 
   name: install and configure DB
   hosts: testServer
   

   vars: 
      oracle_db_port_value : 1521
   
   tasks:
   -name: Install the Oracle DB
      yum: <code to install the DB>
    
   -name: Ensure the installed service is enabled and running
   service:
      name: <your service name>

Q:-What are different YAML tags in playbook?
Ans:-
name 
This tag specifies the name of the Ansible play. As in what this playbook will be doing. Any logical name can be given to the playbook.

hosts
This tag specifies the lists of hosts or host group against which we want to run the task. The hosts field/tag is mandatory. It tells Ansible on which hosts to run the listed tasks. The tasks can be run on the same machine or on a remote machine. One can run the tasks on multiple machines and hence hosts tag can have a group of hosts’ entry as well.

vars
Vars tag lets you define the variables which you can use in your playbook. Usage is similar to variables in any programming language.

tasks
All playbooks should contain tasks or a list of tasks to be executed. Tasks are a list of actions one needs to perform. A tasks field contains the name of the task. This works as the help text for the user. It is not mandatory but proves useful in debugging the playbook. Each task internally links to a piece of code called a module. A module that should be executed, and arguments that are required for the module you want to execute.	  

Q What are the basic steps YAML script?
Step 1:- start with ---
Step 2:- Target section list(hosts,user, etc)
Step 3:- Variable list (optional)
Step 4:- Task list
           List all the modules that you run, in the order
Step 5:- Save file with YAML		  
Assignment:-Run the following commands 
     on host1 and host2 :- execute sh file(date.sh)
     on host1 :- find files and folders of /etc 
     on host2 :- run date command
     on master:- find files and folders of /home	 

--------------------Variables--------------------------
Q: What do you mean by Creating valid variable names?
Ans:Variable names should be letters, numbers, and underscores. Variables should always start with a letter.a1,a1_,file
    Variable names should not be a reserved ansible keywords.
	foo_port is a great variable. foo5 is fine too.
	foo-port, foo port, foo.port and 12 are not valid variable names.	
    
	YAML also supports dictionaries which map keys to values. For instance:
	foo:
	  field1: one
	  field2: two
	You can then reference a specific field in the dictionary using either bracket notation or dot notation:

	foo['field1']
	foo.field1	
Q: Give a simple example of variables in YAML script

----------------------------------------------Loops-----------------------

Q:-What is loop in YAML?
Ans:- It is the repeation of tasks

example:-If you want to create 3 directories on host machine


 - hosts: 172.31.27.53
   tasks:
   - name: Create a dir1
     command: mkdir /tmp/dir1
   -name: Create a dir2
    command: mkdir /tmp/dir2
   -name: Create dir3
    command: mkdir /tmp/dir3

Now lets create above tasks with Loops

---
 - hosts: 172.31.27.53
   tasks:
   - name: Create a dire
     command: mkdir /tmp/"{{ item }}"
     with_items:
     - new_dir1
     - new_dir2
     - new_dir3

----------Create users in host machine

---
 - hosts: 172.31.27.53
   tasks:
   - name: add several users
     user:
       name: "{{ item }}"
       state: present
       groups: "wheel"
     with_items:
     - testuser1
     - testuser2


	


Ansible Playbooks
An organised unit of scripts, Defines works for server configuration and written in YAML

Playbooks have number of plays
Play contains tasks
Tasks calls core of custom modules
Handlers get triggered from notify and executed in the end only once

demo
---
- hosts: 172.31.15.149
  name: play1
  tasks:
    - name: home dir
      command: ls -l /home
      register: output
    - debug:
        var: output.stdout
    - name: execute date
      command: date
      register: result
    - debug:
        var: result.stdout

- hosts: 172.31.27.6
  name: play2
  tasks:
    - name: installing Apache
      yum: name=httpd state=latest
    - name: start apache service
      service: name=httpd state=started



----------------Lookup
Q:How to read a file from Ansible and store in the varaible?
Ans: We use lookup command which is used to read the data source from external file.

Eg:-Read the content of test.csv file

---
 - hosts: all
   vars:
      contents: "{{ lookup('file', 'test.csv') }}"
   tasks:
      - debug: msg="the value of test.txt is {{ contents }}"
-------------------Rolling updates
Q:- How to define the batch size while executing the an action?
Ans By default, Ansible will try to manage all of the machines referenced in a play in parallel. For a rolling update use case, 
    you can define how many hosts Ansible should manage at a single time by using the serial keyword:
	
	---
 - hosts: all
   serial: 2
   name: play1
   tasks:
     - name: This is the testing
       command: ls /home
In the above example, if we had 4 hosts in the group ‘webservers’, 2 would complete the play completely before moving on to the next 2 hosts:
If the number of hosts does not divide equally into the number of passes, the final pass will contain the remainder.

- name: test play
  hosts: all
  serial:
  - 1
  - 5
  - 10
  
  In the above example, the first batch would contain a single host, the next would contain 5 hosts, and (if there are any hosts left), every following batch would contain 10 hosts until all available hosts are used.
  
  ------------------Maximum Failure
  
  - hosts: webservers
    max_fail_percentage: 30
    serial: 10
In the above example, if more than 3 of the 10 servers in the group were to fail, the rest of the play would be aborted.

--------------delegate_to

---
 - hosts: 172.31.27.53
   tasks:
   - name: create dir1
     command: mkdir /tmp/"{{ item }}"
	 delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
     loop:
     - new_dir11
     - new_dir21
     - new_dir31


---
 - hosts: 172.31.27.53
   tasks:
   - name: create dir1
     local_action: command mkdir /tmp/"{{ item }}"
     loop:
     - new_dir11
     - new_dir21
     - new_dir31

  


 ansible-playbook -i hosts demo1.yaml
 
 
 ---
- name: play1
  hosts:  172.31.27.53
  tasks:
     - stat:
        path: /tmp/test
       register: p
     - debug:
         msg: "Path exists and is a directory {{ p.stat.isdir }} "
       when: p.stat.isdir is defined and p.stat.isdir
     - name: " command is to be executed"
       command: ls -l /home
       when: p.stat.isdir == False
- name: play2
  hosts: 172.31.27.53
  tasks:
   - copy:
      dest: /tmp/test3.txt
      content: "Test"
- name: play3
  hosts: 172.31.27.53
  tasks:
    - name: read the file
      command: cat /tmp/test3.txt
      register: p
    - name: create the directory
      command: mkdir /tmp/Testing
      when: p.stdout == "Test"
 
 
 ---------------------Ansible Roles-----------------
 Roles Simplifies to write the complex workbooks
 Roles allows you to reuse the common configuration step between different types of steps.
 Roles are flexible and easily modified.
 
 --------------Structure of an Ansible roles consist of given components
 Defaults:-Stores data about roles and default variables.
 Files:-Store files which is to be pushed to the remote machine.
 Handlers:- Tasks that get triggered from some action.
 Meta :- Information about author, supported platforms and dependencies.
 Tasks:-Contains main list of tasks to be executed by roles.
 Templates:-Contains Templates which can be deployed via role.
 Vars:- Stores variables with high priorty than default variables.
 
 
 Goto roles folder and create following folders
 defaults files handlers meta tasks templates tests vars
